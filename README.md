# Multimodal-Detector vs Unimodal Deepfake Detector.
This project explores the efficiency of a Multimodal Deepfake Detector (Video + Audio) using a transformer vs a Unimodal Deepfake Detector (Video only) using CNN architecture.
The DFDC dataset was used to train, validate and test both models.
The model architectures and training scripts are available here.

Preprocessing:
  - Audio Preprocessing Pipeline (Multimodal Detector)
  - Video Preprocessing Outline (Multi and Unimodal Detector)
Architectures:
  - Audio Spectrogram Architecture (Multimodal Detector)
  - CNN Model (Unimodal Detector)
  - Joint Training (Multimodal Detector)
  - Vision Transformer Architecture (Multimodal Detector)
